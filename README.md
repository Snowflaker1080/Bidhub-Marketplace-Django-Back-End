Core Features (MVP)

    •	Auth: Register, login, logout (Django session auth; UI reflects signed-in state)
    •	Listings: Create, read, update, delete your own listings
    •	Bids: Place, edit, delete your own bids; see bid history on a listing
    •	Dashboard: Quick access to “My Listings”, “My Bids”, and “Purchases”
    •	Search & Filter: Basic keyword search and category filter
    •	A11y & UX: Consistent UI, keyboard-navigable forms, colour-contrast safe

    Stretch ideas: “Watchlist”, email notifications, wallet/balance view, image uploads, closing auctions + winner logic.

Data Model (ERD)

Authentication

    •	Django session-based authentication (cookie) with CSRF protection.
    •	Frontend checks session via a me endpoint (e.g. /api/auth/me/) and guards routes using ProtectedRoute.jsx.
    •	Only the owner can update/delete their Listing or Bid in both UI and server-side checks.
